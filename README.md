## Summary

SCBeauty is a modern web application built using TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that adds additional features to the language to improve code quality and maintainability. TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and reduce errors. The front-end of the application is built with React.js, a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. React.js is used to create components that make up the application's user interface. These components are written in a combination of TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. TypeScript is used to define the props and state of each component, while JavaScript is used to handle logic and events. CSS is used to style the components, and HTML is used to structure the content. The back-end of the application is built with Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine. Node.js is used in conjunction with Express, a lightweight web framework for Node.js, to handle incoming requests and serve data from the database. Overall, SCBeauty2 leverages a combination of technologies and programming languages to create a fast, scalable, and user-friendly web application.
